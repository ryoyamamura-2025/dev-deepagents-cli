# DeepAgents WebApp Project Plan

## 1. Requirements

- Create a web-based user interface for the `deepagents` CLI tool.
- The UI should provide a chat-like interface for interacting with the agent.
- The application will be built using the **NiceGUI** framework.
- The agent's output, including real-time streaming and logs, must be displayed within the UI.
- All project requirements and the task list (TODOs) are to be documented in this file.
