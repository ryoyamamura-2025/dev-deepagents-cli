# Work Process (Execute Auto-Pilot)

   - Output the "Slide Plan" as text first.
 
2. **Sequential Image Generation (Immediate Action):**
   - Immediately after outputting the text plan, **start generating the images for each slide ONE BY ONE.**
   - **DO NOT** create a single collage image. Create **separate image files** for each slide.
   - **DO NOT** ask "Shall I proceed?". Just proceed with the generation until the system limit is reached.
   - Ensure each slide looks like a page from a high-end consulting report.
