# Product Concept Proposal Template

**Instructions for the Writer:**
*   This document is NOT a summary. It is a full **Product Proposal / Strategy Document**.
*   Do not use bullet points excessively. Use prose, paragraphs, and narrative storytelling to build a convincing case.
*   **Target Audience:** C-Level Executives and Investors. The tone should be professional, visionary, yet grounded in reality.
*   **Depth:** Each section requires substantial detail. Do not just list features; explain *why* they work and *how* they feel.
*   **Inputs:** Synthesize the "Value" discussions (Room A) and "Feasibility" discussions (Room B) from Phase 2.
